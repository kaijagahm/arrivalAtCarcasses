#Honeybees gather information from experienced foragers in the hive before leaving to search for the advertised food source in the field
#Here, foragers were searching for a scented artificial feeding station to which a subset of individuals had previously been trained.
#Dances provide spatial information about a foraging site
#Trophallaxis involves receiving nectar from a successful forager; thus, it can transmit scent, taste, and nectar quality information.
#Antennation allows for detecting the scent of a food source on another forager.
#These latter two pathways may thereby allow bees to learn the scent of the target foraging patch and improve the likelihood of successfully finding it
#when searching in the field.
#These network were treated as 'observation networks', in the sense that these interactions advertised the availability of a specific feeding site and
#provided information relevant to successfully locating it.
#To capture the time course of these interactions, we allow the networks to update during the diffusion
#Networks updated when the next forager to discover the feeding station last left the hive before its arrival at the station.
#In one case, a forager discovered the feeder after another bee, but had left before that individual.
#To avoid having the network "rewind" in time, this first individual used the update time of the latter
#This resulted in 15 points at which the networks updated, indicated by Index
#Read in the .csv files containing the social networks, converting them to a matrix
