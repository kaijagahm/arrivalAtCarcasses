#We are not sure which of these variables to include in our model, and decide to use a multi-model inference approach.
#The first stage is to define the set of models we are interested in. Recall that we can specify a model simpler than the one determined by the nbdaData
#object by using constrainedNBDAdata, to cut down the data, and then fit the model to the constrained data. Inside the constrainedNBDAdata function, we
#specify a constraintsVect giving the way in which the data/model is constrained.
#Any parameters with a 0 are constrained to be 0 (omitted from the model), and any parameters with the same non-zero number are constrained to be the same,
#with the restriction that only parameters of the same type can be constrained to be the same: i.e. only 2 or more s parameters, 2 or more effects on asocial
#learning; 2 or more effects on social learning; or 2 or more multiplicative effects.
#e.g. here constraintsVect=c(1,2,0,0,3), would be a social model with an effect of sex on asocial learning and an effect of age on social learning.

#To specify a set of models, we construct a constraintsVectMatrix, with each row giving a constraintsVect and specifying a different model in the set.

constraintsVectMatrix<-rbind(
  #The full model

#or you could write code to generate all combinations, or create the table in Excel and import it into R

#To fit the set of models we use
modelSet_uc<-oadaAICtable(nbdadata = nbdaData2_uc,constraintsVectMatrix =constraintsVectMatrix)

#We can print out the set of models ordered by AICc as follows:
print(modelSet_uc)
#This shows us the model number (row in the original constraintsVectMatrix)
#Model type- asocial, unconstrained if ILVs are affecting social learning or additive if they are affecting only asocial learning, NA if there are no ILVs
#netCombo we will come to below
#baseline is NA because this is an OADA
#The next columns beginning with CONS are the constraints vector defining that model
#The next columns beginning with OFF are the offset vector used to define the model (here not used)
#convergence says whether the optimisation algorithm "thinks" it has converged
#loglik the -log-likelihood for the model
#next are the parameter estimates; these are set to zero if the parameter is constrained to zero
#next are the SEs
#then AIC and AICc; AICc is used by default
#deltaAICc is the difference in AICc from the best model, the relative support for the model compared to the best model, and the Akaike weight

#Here we can see we do not have a clearly favoured best model, so it makes sense to use multi-model inferencing

#The first thing we can do is get support for the network
networksSupport(modelSet_uc)
#which tells us that network 1 has 98.5% support compared to 1.5% support for no network (asocial)
#But we can also see that the number of models is not equal (see main text) so this is not a good way to compare support for social and asocial models
typeSupport(modelSet_uc)
#We can also break down support by model type, but again we have unequal model numbers so this is not so useful here

#More useful is the total support for each variable:
variableSupport(modelSet_uc)
#Showing some support (60%) for an effect of sex on asocial learning but little support for other effects of ILVs
#s1 also has high support but is present in more models than it is absent as we saw above, so this could be misleading

#We can get model averaged estimated as follows:
modelAverageEstimates(modelSet_uc)

#If we prefer, we can get model weighted medians instead (see main text):
modelAverageEstimates(modelSet_uc,averageType = "median")

#We can get unconditional SEs:
unconditionalStdErr(modelSet_uc)

#A neat way to tie this up together is:

rbind(
  support=variableSupport(modelSet_uc),
  MAE=modelAverageEstimates(modelSet_uc),
  USE=unconditionalStdErr(modelSet_uc))

#We could use the USE to generate Wald CIs, but we saw this can be misleading in an NBDA where profile likelihoods are asymmetrical
#We already know that the profile likelihoods are asymmetrical for the 2 parameters with support here from a previous tutorial.

#One option would be to obtain the profile likelihood 95% CI for every model in which an s parameter is present and check how robust these are to model
#selection uncertainty. However, we have seen in previous tutorials that finding the 95% CIs is an interactive process, with the user finding the points
#at which the profile -log-likelihood crosses the maximum -log-likelihood +1.92 cutoff line.

#That said, it is quite easy to find the lower limit for an s parameter, since we know it must be between 0 and the MLE for s in that model.
#So we can use an automated procedure to find the lower limit for s in each model and the estimate of propST (%ST) corresponding to this. It is the lower
#limit for s that is likely to be of most interest, since this tells us the strength of evidence for social transmission.

#We can obtain the lower limit of an s parameter (determined by which if there are more than 1) for a given confidence level
#(conf) in all models containing that parameter as follows:

#This function also returns the propST corresponding to each lower limit.
#deltaAICc is the difference in AICc from the best model in the full set provided to the function
#akaikeWeight is the corresponding Akaike weight from the full model set.
#adjAkWeight is the adjusted Akaike weight conditional on the parameter being in the model (so they sum to one in this reduced set)
#cumulAdjAkWeight is the cumulative adjusted Akaike weight.

#We can see that in the top few models, the lower limit for s and propST is consistently above 0.3 and 45%, but the effect gets plausibly smaller as we move down the table.
#Across all models, the lower 95% CI for s goes as low as 0.011 and propST as low as 0.223 (22.3%).
#But seeing this at least adds to our confidence that we have good evidence for social transmission, since 0 is outside the 95% CI in all models.

#But these lowest values for lowerCI and propST are in the most implausible models, so these are highly conservative lower limits
#for the effect of social transmission.

#We can obtain a model averaged lower-limit for propST as follows:

#However, in a TADA we likely want to consider different baseline functions too. So we want to consider all possible sets of ILVs in an
#unconstrained and an asocial model for the constant, weibull and gamma baseline functions
#So we want to replicate the constraintsVectMartix above 3 times:
constraintsVectMatrixAll<-rbind(constraintsVectMatrix,constraintsVectMatrix,constraintsVectMatrix)

#And we also need to provide a vector saying what baseline function each model will have:

baselineVect<-rep(c("constant","weibull","gamma"),each=dim(constraintsVectMatrix)[1])

#Check:
cbind(baselineVect,constraintsVectMatrixAll)

#To fit the set of models, we use
modelSet_tada<-tadaAICtable(nbdadata = nbdaData_tada,constraintsVectMatrix =constraintsVectMatrixAll,baselineVect = baselineVect)
#Note that progress slows as we get to the gamma models since these take longer to fit

#Aside: for both oadaAICtable and tadaAICtable, we can use multiple cores on the computer to speed things up. Most modern computers have at least 4 cores, and 8 "virtual cores".
#So you can probably use 6 and still have computing power left to do other things on your computer while you wait; just specify cores=6. If you have more cores, you can specify more.
#You do not get a progress bar when using multiple cores
modelSet_tada<-tadaAICtable(nbdadata = nbdaData_tada,constraintsVectMatrix =constraintsVectMatrixAll,baselineVect = baselineVect,cores=6)

print(modelSet_tada)
#We can see that the table now also specifies a baseline function for each model, and values for the baseline parameters too
#We can get the support for each baseline as follows:
baselineSupport(modelSet_tada)
#             support numberOfModels
#constant 0.3370271             20
#gamma    0.5212694             20
#weibull  0.1417035             20

#We can then get support for each combination of networks across all models

#So if we assume a constant baseline rate, we get strong evidence of a strong social transmission effect.
#If we assume a weibull baseline function, we get at least reasonable evidence of social transmission in all models
#since in all but the weakest model the 95% CI does not include 0, but in some models the effect is plausibly quite weak (low
#propST).
#If we assume a gamma baseline function, many models have 95% CI including 0, or very low plausible effects for social transmission.

#In cases like this, where the conclusions are strongly dependent on the assumptions about baseline rate,
#it shows that the analysis is dominated by the time course of events rather than the pattern of spread through the network.
#Unless there is a good a priori reason to believe that the baseline rate is constant, we would recommend switching to OADA in
#such cases, which ignores the time course of events and is only sensitive to the pattern of spread through the network.

#Let us assume we have 4 competing hypotheses about social transmission.
#1. Transmission through network 1 only (s2=0)
#2. Transmission through network 2 only (s1=0)
#3. Transmission through network 1 and network 2 at equal rates per unit connection (s1=s2)
#4. Transmission through network 1 and network 2 at different rate (no constraint)

#Each of these can be represented by different constraints between the s parameters, which we refer to as a network combination or netcombo:
#1. 1 0
#2. 0 1
#3. 1 1
#4. 1 2

#We can fit models with each netcombo and compare the fit. However, we are unsure which ILVs to include, so we want to use multi-model inference
#We need to set up a constraintsVectMatrix that considers each netcombo but also every combination of ILVs

# TUTORIAL 7.5
# MULTI-MODEL INFERENCE IN A cTADA: INCLUDING A HOMOGENEOUS NETWORK
# 1 diffusion
# 1 static network
# 2 time constant ILVs
#############################################################################

# We can include multiple networks in a TADA in the same way as described for an OADA in tutorial 7.4.
# Furthermore, in a TADA, even when we only have one social network of interest, we may wish to include
# a homogeneous network in our multi-model procedure (see tutorial 4.3).
# If we have multiple diffusions and use a cTADA we may also want to include a group network (see tutorial
# 6.5)
# In this tutorial we show how to include a homogeneous network in a multi-model inference procedure for
# a cTADA of a single diffusion. A group network could be included in a cTADA/ stratified OADA of multiple
# diffusions in the same way.


#We use the same data as for tutoral 7.3:
#########################################
#Read in the social network and order of acquisition vector as shown in Tutorials 1 and 2
socNet1<-as.matrix(read.csv(file="jane_13307_exampleStaticSocNet.csv"))
socNet1<-array(socNet1,dim=c(30,30,1))
oa1<-c(26,29,30,8,19,21,22,3,14,12,11,1,17,28,5,9,15,7,6,25,4,13,27,18,20,24,23,16,2,10)

ILVdata<-read.csv(file="jane_13307_exampleTimeConstantILVs.csv")
#Then extract each ILV
female<-cbind(ILVdata$female)
male<-1-female
#females=0 males=1
age<-cbind(ILVdata$age)
#age in years
#I am going to standardize age
stAge<-(age-mean(age))/sd(age)

asoc<-c("male","stAge")

#Now in addition, we need a vector giving the times at which each individual acquired the behaviour:
ta1<-c(234,252,262,266,273,296,298,310,313,326,332,334,334,337,338,340,343,367,374,376,377,393,402,405,407,407,435,472,499,567)
#######################################

#Now we add in the homogeneous network as a second network:
dim(socNet1)
socNets<-array(NA,dim=c(30,30,2))
socNets[,,1]<-socNet1
socNets[,,2]<-1


#Create an object for the "unconstrained" model
nbdaData_tada<-nbdaData(label="ExampleDiffusion2",assMatrix=socNets,orderAcq = oa1,asoc_ilv = asoc,int_ilv=asoc,timeAcq = ta1,endTime = 568)

#Now we have an object with two networks- the first is the social network, the second the homogeneous network

#Now for the model set, we consider all possible sets of ILVs in an unconstrained model for both social and
#homogeneous networks and an asocial model too:

constraintsVectMatrix<-rbind(
  #social network models (1 in first slot, 0 in second)
  c(1,0,0,0,0,0),
  c(1,0,0,0,0,2),

#Again, in a TADA we likely want to consider different baseline functions too. 
#To speed things up we will just consider the constant and weibull baseline functions here,
#so we want to replicate the constraintsVectMartix above 2 times:
constraintsVectMatrixAll<-rbind(constraintsVectMatrix,constraintsVectMatrix)

#And we also need to provide a vector saying what baseline function each model will have.


baselineVect<-rep(c("constant","weibull"),each=dim(constraintsVectMatrix)[1])

#Check:
cbind(baselineVect,constraintsVectMatrixAll)

#To fit the set of models, we use
modelSet_tada<-tadaAICtable(nbdadata = nbdaData_tada,constraintsVectMatrix =constraintsVectMatrixAll,baselineVect = baselineVect)


#We can then get support for each combination of networks across all models
networksSupport(modelSet_tada)
#       support numberOfModels
#0:0 0.02347081              8
#0:1 0.03745207             32
#1:0 0.93907712             32

#Here we can see that the social network (1:0= 93.9%) has far more support than the homogeneous network (0:1= 3.7%) and the number of
#models is the same making this a fair comparison. The ratio of support is
0.93907712/0.03745207 
#One could report this result as something like:
# "25.1x more support for the social network than the homogeneous network, providing evidence that the diffusion follows the
# social network."

#One could then proceed to make inferences as in tutorial 7.3 above. Given the different scales of the networks, it would be reasonable
#to refit the model set to just include the social network before calculating model-averaged estimates. However, if the support for
#the homogeneous network is tiny (e.g. <0.1%) then it is unlikely to affect the model-averaged estimates at all.
